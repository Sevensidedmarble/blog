CopyQ is without a doubt the most amazing clipboard manager on Linux.

# Saving new commands is really cool (especially if you copy them)

CopyQ has a unique method for adding new commands you find on the internet that I've never really seen before in another application. If you copy the text of a CopyQ command like this:

```
insert command here
```

You can then open the commands list in CopyQ and just hit `ctrl-v` to paste into the window. And like that it just parses your paste output and adds the command you had in your clipboard. It feels kinda magical when you do it.
