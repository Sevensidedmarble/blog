  </div><div data-v-e783d790><p>A project I've been working on lately has had the need to handle loads of Stripe webhooks that I haven't been particularly thrilled about writing myself.</p>
<p>Luckily, I found a gem called <code>stripe_event</code> that seemed to handle a good 50% of the workload for me. I wouldn't have to write any of the boilerplate around listening for the list of different events, instead I could just focus on my code for handling the specific events I cared about.</p>
<p>I wanted to integrate this gem with Sinatra, but I found it worked a lot better in Rails (in terms of just dropping in and working right away with less configuration).</p>
<p>So away I went, trying to see just how lightweight I could make Ruby on Rails.</p>
