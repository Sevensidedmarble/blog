I wouldn't have to write any of the boilerplate around listening for the list of different events, instead I could just focus on my code for handling the specific events I cared about.\n\nI wanted to integrate this gem with Sinatra, but I found it worked a lot better in Rails (in terms of just dropping in and working right away with less configuration).\n\nSo away I went, trying to see just how lightweight I could make Ruby on Rails.\n","author":"sevensidedmarble","published":false,"date":"13.
