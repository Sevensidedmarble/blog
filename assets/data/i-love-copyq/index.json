If you copy the text of a CopyQ command like this:\n\n```\ninsert command here\n```\n\nYou can then open the commands list in CopyQ and just hit `ctrl-v` to paste into the window. And like that it just parses your paste output and adds the command you had in your clipboard. It feels kinda magical when you do it.\n","author":"sevensidedmarble","published":false,"date":"13.
