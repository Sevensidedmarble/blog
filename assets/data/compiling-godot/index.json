To use it, you need to compile Godot from source.\n\nI had some issues getting this to work at first, and eventually realized I\nneeded the `libglvnd` package on Arch. I'm not sure why the documentation\ndoesn't mention this on the Arch Wiki. Maybe my system is just weird. But you\ncan try to install it all with:\n\n```sh\npacman -S libglvnd scons pkgconf gcc libxcursor libxinerama \\\n  libxi libxrandr mesa glu alsa-lib pulseaudio freetype2 yasm\n```\n\nHope that helps you if you're getting any weird errors compiling Godot.\n","author":"sevensidedmarble","published":true,"date":"13.
