Although I appreciate Android Studio, as\nit is a pretty well made IDE, this is linux we're talking about--we have vim,\nemacs, etc., we don't need big IDEs if we don't want them.\n\nThis is roughly what I've done to set up a dev environment for Flutter.\n\n# Package installation\n\nUsing your AUR helper of choice (I personally use `yay`):\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nyay -S android-platform android-sdk android-sdk-build-tools \\\n  android-sdk-platform-tools flutter flutter-dev android-emulator\n```\n\nThen, as per the Arch Wiki, create a new group for the android-sdk directory:\n\n```bash\n# Add a new group\ngroupadd android-sdk\n\n# Add our user to the group\ngpasswd -a ${USER} android-sdk\n\n# Set permissions in this directory\nsetfacl -R -m g:android-sdk:rwx /opt/android-sdk\nsetfacl -d -m g:android-sdk:rwX /opt/android-sdk\n\n# This is only necessary if you don't want to log out and back in\nnewgrp android-sdk\n```\n\nAnd then use `sdkmanager` to set up the Android binaries/emulator/etc.\n\n```bash\n# Download the packages we need\n# Note: I am not an Android expert, not sure if you really need all these\nsdkmanager \"platform-tools\" \"platforms;android-29\" \"emulator\"\n```\n\nAccept the software licenses:\n\n```bash\nsdkmanager --licenses\n```\n\nYou should be able to run `flutter doctor -v` then to ensure everything is setup correctly.\n\n# That should be it right?\n\nUnfortunately, these instructions don't seem to really work for me. Even after\na login/logout, the permissions via the new group we create above did not work\nfor me. These were instructions on the Arch Linux Wiki. Instead, I ended up\nchanging the group to my users group:\n\n```bash\nchown root:marble -R /opt/android-sdk\n```\n\nThen things worked relatively well for me. I don't really know why the group hack in\nthe wiki doesn't work for me.\n","author":"sevensidedmarble","published":true,"date":"5.
