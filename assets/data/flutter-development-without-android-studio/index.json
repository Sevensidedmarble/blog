Although I appreciate Android Studio, as\nit is a pretty well made IDE, this is linux we're talking about--we have vim,\nemacs, etc., we don't need big IDEs if we don't want them.</p>\n<p>This is roughly what I've done to set up a dev environment for Flutter.</p>\n<h1 id=\"package-installation\"><a href=\"#package-installation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Package installation</h1>\n<p>Using your AUR helper of choice (I personally use <code>yay</code>):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Install dependencies\nyay -S android-platform android-sdk android-sdk-build-tools \\\n  android-sdk-platform-tools flutter flutter-dev android-emulator\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, as per the Arch Wiki, create a new group for the android-sdk directory:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Add a new group\ngroupadd android-sdk\n\n# Add our user to the group\ngpasswd -a ${USER} android-sdk\n\n# Set permissions in this directory\nsetfacl -R -m g:android-sdk:rwx /opt/android-sdk\nsetfacl -d -m g:android-sdk:rwX /opt/android-sdk\n\n# This is only necessary if you don't want to log out and back in\nnewgrp android-sdk\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then use <code>sdkmanager</code> to set up the Android binaries/emulator/etc.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\"># Download the packages we need\n# Note: I am not an Android expert, not sure if you really need all these\nsdkmanager \"platform-tools\" \"platforms;android-29\" \"emulator\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Accept the software licenses:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">sdkmanager --licenses\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should be able to run <code>flutter doctor -v</code> then to ensure everything is setup correctly.</p>\n<h1 id=\"that-should-be-it-right\"><a href=\"#that-should-be-it-right\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>That should be it right?</h1>\n<p>Unfortunately, these instructions don't seem to really work for me. Even after\na login/logout, the permissions via the new group we create above did not work\nfor me. These were instructions on the Arch Linux Wiki. Instead, I ended up\nchanging the group to my users group:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">chown root:marble -R /opt/android-sdk\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then things worked relatively well for me. I don't really know why the group hack in\nthe wiki doesn't work for me.</p>\n","author":"sevensidedmarble","published":true,"date":"5.
